### Focus Areas
I focused on creating a clean, visually appealing and easy-to-use user interface, because I think my eye for detail and UX considerations are some of my greatest strengths as a developer. I also spent a significant amount of time ensuring that data is fetched asynchronously and images are cached appropriately, in order to achieve efficiency and good performance. 

### Time Spent
I spent approximately 10 hours on this project, over the course of a few days. I spent my first few hours getting comfortable with SwiftUI (since I'm used to using UIkit in my current position) and creating the basic tab bar layout while thinking of features to include. Then, I moved into implementing and testing the backend functionality, including the Swift class that manages all the recipe data. After that, I created the three main views, figuring out how to share the recipe data between them. Next, I implemented and tested image caching. Once the layout was working and the data was being loaded properly, I put finishing touches on the UI and finalized with unit tests. 

### Trade-offs and Decisions
I don't think I made any major trade-offs; I think the app is comprehensive in its simplicity, and I feel good about the features I added. With more time and a larger scale, I would certainly add more features, like users and sign-ins so that the saved recipes could persist. 

### Weakest Part of the Project
Again, I think a user would expect to be able to save recipes more permanently, so accounts would be an important feature to add in production. One bit of functionality that I don't love if that if a user selects a cuisine in the Explore by Cuisine tab, tapping the Explore by Cuisine tab button again does not send them back to the list of cuisines; the user has to select the back button on the top left. I think the expected behavior would be that the tab button takes the user back to the initial tab screen. 

### Additional Information
I wasn't super familiar with SwiftUI going into this project, but I did some research on how to get started, and I learned a lot in the process! I feel like I grew very comfortable with SwiftUI, and I plan to keep working with it and improving my skills.
